## About Me
I am Isabel Armstrong and I am 21 years old. I am currently a student at Weber State University. Upon graduation, I aim to land myself a career in software development. I find the subject of computer science to be very compelling and am always wanting to learn more whenever I can.

## Projects

For this assignment, I created two different forms. One prompts the user for their name and their favorite food, which is them saved to a text file. It then displays all users and their favorite foods. On the other form, it prompts for just a favorite food to search by. When submitted, the next page then displays the users with the given food as their favorite food.

Since I was new to Node at the time, I did have a hard time with some of the aspects of this assginment. I had a hard time understanding how exactly I could read and write to a text file. I did eventually figure what exactly I needed to use and how to use it to my advantage.
